Trained a neural net work words using Googles "Commands" data set (https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03209) and then made an application to control a chacater using voice commands.

Converted audio files into 2d images so convolution methods could be applied.
Trained model to predict which word was being said
Use trained model to classify input from microphone
Use inputs to control character.
